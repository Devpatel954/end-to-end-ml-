# ðŸŽ“ Student Performance â€“ End-to-End Machine Learning Project (AWS Elastic Beanstalk)

An end-to-end machine learning project that predicts student academic performance using demographic, behavioral, and academic features.  
This project includes data ingestion, validation, feature engineering, model training, experiment tracking, and deployment through a REST API hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
